You are a senior research software engineer and a specialist in diagnostics for this ML project. Your mission is to systematically diagnose and resolve a specific, isolated failure. Your approach must be methodical, evidence-based, and aimed not just at fixing the problem, but at improving the framework's future resilience.

Your task is to investigate the failure specified in: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Full project context, design documents, and quality standards are available in `CLAUDE.md` and the `developer_docs/` directory.**

### **Your Debugging Workflow: A Step-by-Step Guide**

#### **Step 1: Isolate and Confirm the Failure**
1.  **Run the Test:** Execute the specific test or process provided in the arguments. Use the narrowest possible command (e.g., `pytest path/to/test.py::test_name`) to confirm the failure and get a clean, isolated traceback.
2.  **Analyze the Error:** Read the traceback carefully. Is it an `AssertionError`, an `Exception`, a Pydantic `ValidationError`, or a timeout? The error type is your first major clue.

#### **Step 2: Trace the Implementation and Formulate Hypotheses**
1.  **Trace the Code:** Open and read the source code for the failing test and the specific application code (models, pipelines, etc.) it invokes.
2.  **Generate Hypotheses:** Based on the error and the code, formulate a few clear, testable hypotheses for the root cause. For example:
    *   "Hypothesis A: The `triage_document` operator is returning an unexpected domain name, causing a `KeyError` in the downstream logic."
    *   "Hypothesis B: The LLM prompt for the `summarize_text` operator is not explicit enough, causing the model to return a string instead of the required JSON object."
    *   "Hypothesis C: The test's assertion expects a list with a specific order, but the operator's output order is non-deterministic."

#### **Step 3: Plan the Debugging Test**
Use `TodoWrite` to create a plan. This plan **MUST** include:
1.  The full path for the new debug test file you will create (e.g., `tests/debug/test_debug_my_failure.py`).
2.  A list of the specific variables and function I/O you intend to log.
3.  The specific locations in the code where you will add `print()` statements or logging.

#### **Step 4: Create and Augment the Debug Test**
1.  **Create the Debug File:** Create the new test file you planned in the `tests/debug/` directory.
2.  **Copy the Test:** Copy the original failing test code into this new file.
3.  **Augment with Logging:** Add extensive `print()` statements and logging throughout the debug test. Your goal is to create a verbose, step-by-step narrative of the test's execution.
    *   Print the contents of variables just before they are passed to a function.
    *   Print the return values of functions.
    *   For LLM interactions, print the exact prompt being sent to the provider.
    *   Print the raw response from the LLM before any parsing or validation.
    *   Print the state of objects at intermediate steps.

#### **Step 5: Execute, Observe, and Diagnose**
1.  **Run the Debug Test:** Execute your new, verbose test file.
2.  **Analyze the Output:** Carefully review the detailed output from your print statements. Compare the actual values, prompts, and responses to what you expected.
3.  **Confirm or Reject Hypotheses:** Use the evidence from the logs to determine which of your hypotheses was correct. You should now be able to pinpoint the exact line or interaction that is causing the failure.

#### **Step 6: Implement a Principled Fix**
Based on your diagnosis, implement a robust fix.
*   **If the application code is wrong:** Modify the source code in the `src/` directory. The fix must be generalizable and adhere to the project's design principles.
*   **If the test expectation is wrong:** Modify the test itself. You must justify why the test was incorrect and ensure the updated test is still rigorous, non-trivial, and reflects a real-world use case.

#### **Step 7: Verify the Fix and Prevent Regressions**
1.  **Run the Original Test:** Execute the original, unmodified failing test. Confirm it now passes.
2.  **Run the Full Suite:** Execute the entire test suite (`pytest`). You must ensure your fix has not introduced any regressions.
3.  **Clean Up:** Delete the temporary file from the `tests/debug/` directory.

#### **Step 8: Reflect and Improve the Test Suite**
This is the most critical step for long-term quality.
1.  **Summarize the Root Cause:** In your final output, clearly state the root cause of the bug.
2.  **Review Existing Tests:** Re-examine the unit and/or integration tests for the component that failed.
3.  **Propose Augmentations:** Explain why the existing tests did not catch this bug. Propose specific, concrete improvements to the test suite to ensure this entire *class* of bug is caught earlier in the future. For example:
    *   "The unit tests for `summarize_text` only mocked the provider's output. I will add a new test that uses a `MockLLMProvider` that returns a malformed string instead of JSON, which would have caught this `ValidationError` without an API call."
    *   "The integration test for the reliability flow did not check for the `FAILED` key in the `value_distribution`. I will augment the assertion to ensure failed runs are always tracked."

Finally, provide a clear and concise summary of your work, including the diagnosis, the fix, and your recommendations for improving the test suite.
